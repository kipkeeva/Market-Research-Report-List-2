<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wi Fi Extender Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wi-Fi Range Extender</li><li>Wireless AP Router</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Wi-Fi extender market consists of two main types: Wi-Fi range extenders and wireless AP routers. A Wi-Fi range extender is a device that amplifies the existing Wi-Fi signal to extend its coverage area. It receives the Wi-Fi signal from the main router and rebroadcasts it, ensuring a wider coverage range. On the other hand, a wireless AP router acts as both an access point and a router. It not only extends the Wi-Fi coverage but also creates a new network with its own SSID, allowing more devices to connect simultaneously.</p></p>
