<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CW Radar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Frequency</li><li>Multiple Frequency</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CW radar, also known as Continuous Wave radar, is a type of radar system used for detecting and tracking objects. There are two main types of CW radar systems, namely Single Frequency and Multiple Frequency radar. </p><p>In Single Frequency radar, a single continuous wave is transmitted and received, allowing for simplified hardware design and lower cost. However, it suffers from accuracy limitations due to its inability to differentiate between multiple targets or analyze their detailed characteristics.</p><p>In Multiple Frequency radar, multiple continuous wave signals at different frequencies are transmitted and received simultaneously. This enables better accuracy, as it can differentiate between multiple targets and analyze their details, leading to improved object identification and tracking capabilities.</p></p>
